Mantræ is a web-based configuration manager for Traefik's dynamic configuration file. It provides a clean, intuitive interface to manage your routers, middleware, and services without editing YAML files manually.

<Callout title="Important" type="warn">
  Mantræ is **not** a dashboard for Traefik. It operates independently and does not monitor
  Traefik's status. Instead, Traefik connects to Mantræ to fetch its dynamic configuration.
</Callout>

## Why Mantræ?

Traefik is incredibly powerful, but managing its dynamic configuration through YAML files can become cumbersome as your infrastructure grows. Mantræ simplifies this by providing:

- **Visual Management**: See your entire routing infrastructure at a glance.
- **Centralized Control**: Manage multiple Traefik instances (Profiles) from one place.
- **Automation**: Let agents discover your containers and DNS integration handle your records.
- **Security**: OIDC integration and audit logs for team environments.
