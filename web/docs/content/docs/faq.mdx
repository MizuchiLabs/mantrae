## General Questions

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Why would I use Mantræ instead of Traefik's built-in configuration discovery?">
  Traefik's automatic discovery works great for Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, but many users run Traefik in simpler setups where these features aren't available. Mantræ fills this gap by:

- Providing a visual interface for managing Traefik's file provider configuration.
- Supporting multi-host Docker setups without requiring Swarm or Kubernetes.
- Offering centralized management of multiple Traefik instances.
- Automatically managing DNS records alongside routing configuration.
- Enabling team collaboration with user management and audit logs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Mantræ a replacement for Traefik's dashboard?">
  No. Mantræ is a **configuration manager**, not a monitoring dashboard. It generates the dynamic configuration that Traefik consumes via its HTTP provider. Traefik's dashboard shows real-time routing status and metrics, while Mantræ helps you create and manage those routes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use Mantræ alongside Traefik's other providers (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)?">
  Yes! Mantræ uses Traefik's HTTP provider, which works alongside other providers. You can have Traefik auto-discover some services while managing others through Mantræ. Just be careful to avoid naming conflicts between configurations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if Mantræ goes down?">
  Traefik caches the configuration it receives from Mantræ. If Mantræ becomes unavailable:
  - Existing routes continue to work with the last cached configuration.
  - You cannot make configuration changes until Mantræ is back online.
  - DNS updates (if configured) won't happen until Mantræ recovers.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Profiles

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What are profiles and when should I use them?">
  Profiles are isolated configuration environments within Mantræ. Each profile has its own:
  - Routers, services, and middleware.
  - DNS provider settings.
  - Agent connections.
  - API token for Traefik.

Common use cases:

- Separate configurations for development, staging, and production.
- Different Traefik instances for different teams or projects.
- Isolating configurations by customer in managed hosting scenarios.

</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Agents

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What do agents do and when do I need them?">
  Agents watch Docker containers on remote hosts and automatically create Mantræ configurations based on container labels. Use agents when:

- Your Docker hosts can't be reached directly by Mantræ (behind NAT/firewall).
- You want automatic discovery similar to Traefik's Docker provider.
- Managing multiple Docker hosts from a single Mantræ instance.
- You prefer labeling containers over manual configuration.

If you're managing static configurations or non-Docker services, you don't need agents.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do agents communicate with Mantræ?">
  Agents establish **outbound** connections to the Mantræ server using gRPC. This means:
  - Agents work behind firewalls and NAT (only outbound access needed).
  - No ports need to be opened on the agent's host.
  - Communication can be secured with HTTPS/TLS.
  - Mantræ server must be reachable from agent hosts.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## DNS Integration

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Which DNS providers are supported?">
  Currently supported:
  - Cloudflare
  - PowerDNS
  - Technitium DNS
  - PiHole

DNS integration automatically creates/updates DNS records when you configure routers, eliminating manual DNS management.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle multiple accounts for the same DNS provider?">
  Traefik's ACME challenge only supports one provider instance. Use CNAME delegation:

1. Configure the primary account (e.g., Cloudflare account A with `example.com`).
2. For domains on other accounts (e.g., `example.org` on account B), add a CNAME:
   - **Type**: `CNAME`
   - **Name**: `_acme-challenge.example.org`
   - **Target**: `_acme-challenge.example.com`

This allows Traefik to validate certificates for domains across multiple accounts.
