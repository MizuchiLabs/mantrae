# Environment Variables

Mantrae provides several command-line flags and environment variables to configure the application. This guide details each option and its purpose.

## Command-Line Arguments

You can use the following flags to customize the behavior of Mantrae:

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `-version` | `bool` | `false` | Prints the current version of Mantrae and exits. |
| `-update` | `bool` | `false` | Updates Mantrae to the latest version. (Doesn't work inside a container) |

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can be used to set up Mantrae and configure its settings. Below is a list of the supported environment variables.

### Core Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `SECRET` |         | Secret key required for secure access (required) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` |  | Admin password for the web interface (will be auto-generated if not set) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Logging level (debug, info, warn, error) |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | Log format (text, json) |

### Important Notes

- **SECRET** is a required environment variable and must be set; otherwise, the application will not start.
