# MantrÃ¦

**MantrÃ¦** is a user-friendly web interface designed to simplify the management of Traefik's dynamic configurations. Similar to Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM), this application allows you to manage your dynamic Traefik configuration from the comfort of a simple web ui.

## Features

- **Simplified UI**: A clean and intuitive interface that keeps the complexity to a minimum.
- **Router Configuration**: Create and manage Traefik routers with custom rules, entrypoints, and middleware configurations.
- **Middleware Management**: Add middlewares to your routers, including rate limiting, authentication, and more.
- **Service Status**: Monitor the status of your services and see their health information.
- **DNS Providers**: Support for multiple DNS providers (currently Cloudflare, PowerDNS, Technitium) for automatic DNS record updates.
- **Agents**: Instead of defining your routers in the web ui, you can label your containers as usual using traefik labels. Start the agent on the machine and it will automatically set everything up for you.
